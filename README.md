# Tracking Satellites and Processing Real-Time Telemetry Transmissions
An introduction to satellite communications.

## Scope

This project is intended to outline how to track satellites, receive their live telemetry, and process that data into human-interpretable weather images.


## Disclaimer
This project utilizes tools which are capable of receiving data on satellite-specific radio frequencies. At no point should any attempt be made to transmit on any radio frequency without proper licensing. To reiterate: this project is limited to RECEIVE-ONLY.
